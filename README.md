# appAutoProject

This project performs analysis, preprocessing, and predictive modeling on a weld quality dataset. It walks through steps from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to applying machine learning techniques, including semi-supervised learning, to predict weld quality.

## Project Structure

- **1_FirstEDA.ipynb**: Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the weld dataset.

- **2_DataPreprocessing.ipynb**: Data preprocessing, handling missing values, scaling features, and transformations.

- **3_WeldQualityPrediction.ipynb**: Implements supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for predicting weld quality.

- **4_SemiSupervisedLearning.ipynb**: Applies semi-supervised learning techniques using both labeled and unlabeled data to improve predictions.

## data/

- **welddb.data**: The main dataset.
- **welddb.info**: Metadata about the dataset.
- **welddb.tex**: Additional references related to the dataset.
